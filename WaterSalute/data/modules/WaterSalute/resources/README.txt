# WaterSalute Resources

This folder should contain the following OBJ models:

1. `firetruck.obj` - Fire truck 3D model
2. `waterdrop.obj` - Water particle 3D model

## Model Requirements

### firetruck.obj
- 8x8 fire truck model
- Origin at center bottom
- Facing +Z direction (forward)
- Scale: 1 unit = 1 meter
- Size: approximately 10m long, 2.5m wide, 4m tall

### waterdrop.obj
- Small water droplet/sphere
- Origin at center
- Size: approximately 0.1-0.2m diameter
- Semi-transparent blue material recommended

## Obtaining Models

You can use the models from the WaterSalute C++ plugin (fountains.zip) 
or create your own compatible models.

The plugin will log a warning if these files are not found but will 
still function - you just won't see the trucks or water particles.
